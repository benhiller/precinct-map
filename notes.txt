TODO:
- races where people vote for more than one candidate are weird
- see correlation between candidates/propositions across elections
- see how turnout changes across elections
- compare vbm/e-day turnout
- breakdown at district level rather than precinct level

- load precinct data via URL to mapbox and just rely on turnout data file for generating fill layer?

- zoom into bounding box for relevant precincts for elections that only a subset of Sf voted in

- determine thresholds for colors dynamically based on results + add legend showing ranges?
- improve layout on iphone

Data correctness:
- i think i'm double counting merged precincts in overall results

Tooltip:
- if tooltip would be above window, place it below precinct
- add shadow/arrow to tooltip view
- optimize tooltip changes https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/2874 maybe use setdata instead of setfilter?
- make tooltip more consistent visually with overall results

Done:
- Should use 2012 precinct map for 2016 results
- Include %s in tooltip
- Not taking votes for other dem candidates into account
- Look into better method for determining color for each precinct
- fix selecting total voters/ballots cast "contests"
- investigate error in queryRenderedFeatures that sometimes occurs after changing contest
- see if we can avoid adding/removing layers when changing contest and instead just modify existing layer
- highlight precinct tooltip is showing for
- add all us rep elections
- simplify map style
- add results layer underneath labels
- improve styling of overall results
- handle merged precincts
- handle precincts with 0 voters from 2016 general correctly
- races with more than two main candidates aren't handled well
- show results from several elections
