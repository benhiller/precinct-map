TODO:
- show results from several elections
- see correlation between candidates/propositions across elections
- see how turnout changes across elections
- compare vbm/e-day turnout
- breakdown at district level rather than precinct level
- simplify map style
- add results layer underneath labels

Done:
- Should use 2012 precinct map for 2016 results
- Include %s in tooltip
- Not taking votes for other dem candidates into account
- Look into better method for determining color for each precinct
